# refold tools

this is a repo with refold language learning stuff (primarily japanese):

- [anki sentence mining card template](anki-card-template/)
- [bulk audio adder](bulk-audio/)

no longer maintained:
> - ~[yomichan user.js patch](yomichan/)~ (OBSOLETE)
> - [yomichan stuff](yomichan-user/)
>   (custom theme, ~sentence export/copy button plugin~)
> 
> a lot of shit broke or is no longer possible to implement with the APIs
> present in manifest v3. i've decided to simplify my sentence mining workflow
> instead of creating yet another overengineered and opinionated solution that
> works with mv3.
